# Course Outline

The course covers a series of topics in game theory. Its' intention is to show you how you can use computational methods together with the game theory you have learned to enhance your practice.  We'll cover a series of topics beginning with using symbolic algebra to help you with your game theory, ending with a full project involving relatively advanced theory, unsupervised computer learning, structural estimation and prediction. 

Marking involves a series of assignments, likely six, 50%, then a final term project also 50%.   

At this point you will have become familiar with [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).  You likely have them installed on your own computer (best way if you havent is to use conda - [https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html)).   Install the computer language [julia](https://julialang.org).  It is similar to python but faster.  It is good for the kinds of computation you might do in microeconomics.  It is complementary to [R](https://www.r-project.org/) not a substitute for it.  Since it frees you from matlab, it will save you money if nothing else.

 There is a collection of notebooks you can use during the course.  Clone them from [https://github.com/michaelpetersubc/notebooks](https://github.com/michaelpetersubc/notebooks).
