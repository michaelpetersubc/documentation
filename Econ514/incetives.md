# Course Outline

The course consists of a series of topics in applied game theory.  The first part will illustrate how bayesian game theory can be used to do 
structural estimation.  The applications will involve models that you should have seen before in your previous classes.  The second half of the 
course will show how game theory has influenced computer science and illustrate some of the methods they have devised to enhance the applicability
of the economic models that you have already learned.

There is no textbook for the course, readings will be available online. There will be computation and data analysis used during the course.  It is
recommended that you use jupyter notebooks since they are a great way of experimenting in python and r.  We'll touch some computation that will require
math tools.  It is recommended that you install [sagemath using conda](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/conda.html).  This will give you a basic 
computational mathematical tools and the ability to use python.

Install the jupyterlab extension for sagemath and you will have a very nice development environment.  One way to do this is to activate the sage environment at your 
command line using conda, then `sage -i jupyterlab_widgets`, but suit yourself.  You can enable the R language, and octave through jupyterlab so that you have all the 
basic computer tools you need.

Lectures will be a combination of live and recorded sessions.  There will be extended office hours conducted online where I hang out on [Discord](https://discord.com).  I'll
provide the server location in class, but it you know what the honors discord server is, it will be there.  When you join, change your nickname on the server to your proper name so I can recognize you.

William Duan will be helping with the course as a ta.  He will be available regulary on discord, as will I.

As the class is small enough, grading will be traditional, a mixture of assignments, a midterm (online) and a final.  You'll have the option of replacing these with indvidual
projects.



# Legal stuff

Sorry, wish this wasn't necessary.

It is the policy of the VSE to report all violations of UBCâ€™s standards for academic honesty to the office of the Dean of Arts. You must read these policies a [http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/Vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,286,0,0](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/Vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,286,0,0) In addition to the explicitly stated violations (for example, plagiarism), any student who hires a tutor/editor to help with any portion of their work will be given an automatic grade of zero on their final paper and/or annotated bibliography. Further penalties, in addition to any grade penalties that might apply (such as a zero grade on your final paper), may be levied by the President's Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Those further penalties could include a notation on your transcript indicating that you have committed an academic offence, failure of the course, and/or suspension from the university. 

Notice in particular that UBC prohibits any student from hiring a tutor or editor to help them with their work.
