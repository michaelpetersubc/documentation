# Course Outline

The course covers a series of topics in game theory.  In each case, we'll use modelling techniques that 
make it possible to explore the models themselves computationally and to use them for estimation.  Some exposure to python and julia is helpful, though the course is primarily about theoretical methods. When computational methods are used, they will be explained in class. 

Marking is traditional assignments an tests with an option to substitute projects for tests.
